Engineer specialized in hydrological and hydraulic modeling, flood mapping, GIS and data science. Former {{< staticref "https://www.cowater.com" "newtab" >}}Cowater{{< /staticref >}}, I spent close to 10 years addressing water resources engineering issues around the world. My carreer brought me all the way from water supply and flood mapping in the Sahel desert of West Africa, to post-earthquake water infrastructure vulnerability assessments in Haiti, decentralized wastewater management in remote communities of Alaska, hydraulic modeling in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provice of Pakistan, large-scale mobile surveys for water infrastructure assessments in Jordan and various assignments in almost a dozen other countries. I'm now focusing my work closer to home on hydrological and hydraulic modeling with {{< staticref "https://www.aquasphera.ca" "newtab" >}}Aquasphera{{< /staticref >}}, where we specialize in flood analysis, stormwater management, drainage, erosion control and river modeling with governement and private partners here in Canada.
