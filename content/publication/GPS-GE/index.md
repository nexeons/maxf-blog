abstract: This book shows you how to use a GPS and Google Earth to create simple and expressive maps to share on the web like the one shown on the cover. With a reading time of a mere 10 hours you will learn to work with a GPS without making mistakes, to use it with Google Earth including in areas without internet access and to quickly create diverse interactive maps that other people can see and modify over the internet without the need for experts or unnecessary complications. Even though it has been written in the context of Relief and Development work, the same process is valid for whatever other application.
