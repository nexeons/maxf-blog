**CCE Award of Excellence - International**  
*November 1st, 2017*  
By: 2017 Canadian Consulting Engineering Awards  

**Global Affairs Canada funded this $30M project with the goal of improving the health of residents in 20 towns in Ghana’s Northern Region through improved access to water supply and sanitation services. Cowater International with Norda Stelo provided engineering design, technical assistance, capacity building and management support to the Government of Ghana in the implementation of project activities, resulting in new community-managed water supplies and improved health and quality of life for over 165,000 residents.**  

The Northern Region Small Towns Water & Sanitation (NORST) Project was implemented between 2008 and 2016. At the outset less than 25% of northern Ghana’s rural population was estimated to have access to clean water supplies. The project was co-implemented with Ghana’s Community Water & Sanitation Agency (CWSA) and District towns, who were responsible for procurement of construction services.  

**Multiple benefits**  
The NORST project provided multiple benefits including:  

* New water systems operating in 20 towns, benefiting a population of 165,774. Given the region’s topography and hydrogeology, systems typically include borehole sources with submersible pumps, elevated storage tanks, basic treatment, and distribution to both public and domestic taps.  
* Effective operation and maintenance structures were established in all towns. All benefited from training on operation, maintenance, administration and financial management.  
* All towns now regularly prepare and update District development plans which address water, sanitation and environmental concerns and objectives.  
* Approximately 2,400 latrines constructed; a 13% increase in sanitation coverage.  
* 400 latrine units constructed at elementary and secondary schools, providing service to 19,500 children where facilities were previously inadequate or absent altogether.  
* 10,000 schoolchildren received basic information on health, hygiene and household sanitation through a Healthy Play methodology in which students learn through games and sport. Schools received technical assistance in the methodology, and game/sports equipment to encourage healthy behaviour change.  

**Knowledge transfer**  
The transfer of knowledge and knowhow was the cornerstone of the NORST Project and the foundation for long-term sustainability of project results. Over the eight-year duration, the project strengthened counterparts at the local, regional and national levels. Twelve Canadian experts in areas including water system engineering design and construction, GIS, hydrogeology, sanitation, environmental management, procurement, gender equality and social inclusion, AIDS/HIV, human resources, and communications provided expert technical assistance to Ghanaian stakeholders.  

**Logistics challenge**  
The Project was based in Tamale, over 600km north of the capital city of Accra. Most towns were accessed over unpaved dirt roads which sometimes became impassable during the wet season. Construction supplies and equipment were procured from Accra, and timely distribution to the various work sites was a challenge. Wherever possible, procurement was done in bulk well in advance of schedule and transportation to sites was done during dry months.  

**Exceeding goals**  
Under the overall goal of improving the health of residents, the client defined results to gauge performance, including:  

* Improved access to sustainable potable water supply, and sanitation facilities in selected towns, benefiting a minimum of 125,000 residents;  
* Strengthened capacity of District Water & Sanitation Management Teams to fulfill their mandates in water service delivery, management, operation and maintenance; and  
* Strengthened capacity of government stakeholders to support the planning, construction and operation of small town services.  

A Performance Measurement Framework was established with measurable indicators to gauge performance against baseline values. All NORST water systems are operating within CWSA performance guidelines, and recurrent system costs are being recovered through tariffs. By December 2016, NORST had substantially achieved all Project goals, exceeding by 29% the target of providing new service to 125,000 residents across all towns, among other goals. District towns are now better able to manage, operate and maintain these services, and are more satisfied themselves with the level of support received from government counterparts.
